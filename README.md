# Personal Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio website which is written in React JS. 
It gives a brief about me and showcases all the projects I have worked on. It also highlights the various skills I have gained during the years. 
It is made in a very structured format so that minimal efforts are needed whenever there is a need to update the projects or skills. 

Feel free to use this as a template website to build off of.
